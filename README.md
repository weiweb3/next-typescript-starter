## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx weiweb3 create --template next-typescript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `Weiweb3Provider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.weiweb3.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.weiweb3.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
